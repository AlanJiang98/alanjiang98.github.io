In early 2021, I was very interested in the development of AR hardware and its pain points, so I conducted a research study. My preliminary conclusion was that the optics and display modules faced significant challenges. For those without a hardware background, conducting research and contemplation on interaction is very meaningful. I shared these findings with peers from various backgrounds.
