Under the guidance of Assistant Professor [Yu Yang](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yuy/) from the IIIS at Tsinghua University, [Tenglong Ao](https://aubrey-ao.github.io/) and Jianping Jiang, two junior students from the Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University, released the latest social research report by the AI Project Group of the [Center for International Security and Strategy](https://ciss.tsinghua.edu.cn/column/index), titled ["Artificial Intelligence Risks and Governance from the Perspective of Chinese Youth"](https://www.sklib.cn/booklib/databasedetail?SiteID=122&ID=10188380&searchText=%25E4%25BA%25BA%25E5%25B7%25A5%25E6%2599%25BA%25E8%2583%25BD&fromSubID=). They noted that compared to experts and scholars focusing on AI in politics, military, and security, the youth are more concerned about AI's impact on the economy and society. In their survey, the youth showed heightened interest in issues related to AI and employment, consumption, and personal information security.
